# Sql_Views_Project




I designed and implemented a secure employee management database system to organize and manage employee data effectively. The system includes a comprehensive schema with tables for employee details, such as names, department, job title, and salary, ensuring data integrity and consistency. A custom database view, v_employee, was created to provide restricted access to essential employee information while protecting sensitive data. Role-based access control was implemented, with HR granted full privileges and other departments limited to read-only access via their respective database users. User accounts were secured with unique passwords, ensuring compliance with security best practices. This project highlights my knowledge in database design, SQL programming, and implementing access control mechanisms for real-world applications.
